##  Deployment Plan

To bring the E-Commerce application live, I deployed the **frontend** using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and the **backend** using [Render](https://render.com), both of which provide free-tier hosting and GitHub integration.

###  Backend Deployment â€“ Render

- **Platform**: Render â€“ ideal for hosting Node.js servers and PostgreSQL databases.
- **Steps Taken**:
  1. Pushed the backend code to a GitHub repository.
  2. Connected the repo to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/).
  3. Created a new **Web Service** for the Express server and a **PostgreSQL Database**.
  4. Added necessary environment variables on Render:
     - `PORT`
     - `DATABASE_URL` (from Renderâ€™s PostgreSQL instance)
     - `JWT_SECRET`
  5. Configured `build command` as:
     ```
     npm install && npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
     ```
     and `start command` as:
     ```
     node server.js
     ```
  6. Verified API endpoints using Postman or the browser.

###  Frontend Deployment â€“ Vercel

- **Platform**: Vercel â€“ perfect for React + TypeScript apps with Vite.
- **Steps Taken**:
  1. Pushed the frontend code to GitHub.
  2. Connected the repo to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
  3. Set the environment variable:
     - `VITE_API_URL` â†’ Your deployed backend API URL from Render.
  4. Let Vercel detect the Vite app and deploy automatically.
  5. Confirmed that all API requests from the frontend were working properly.

> ðŸ”„ Updates to either frontend or backend trigger automatic deployments via GitHub commits.

 The project is now live and accessible via the provided Vercel frontend link, communicating securely with the Render backend and PostgreSQL database.
