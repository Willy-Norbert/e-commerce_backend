### UI/UX Design (Figma)

The user interface and experience of WomXchange Rwanda were thoughtfully designed using Figma, a collaborative design tool that allows for fast prototyping and clear communication of interface concepts.
What’s Included in the Figma Design:
Admin Dashboard UI — showing analytics, user data, product stats, and sales performance

**Seller Portal** — for uploading products, viewing orders, and managing inventory


**Buyer Pages** — product listings, cart view, checkout interface


**Authentication Pages** — login/signup interfaces with support for English and Kinyarwanda


**Chatbot Interface** — simple, mobile-friendly chatbot window for user assistance

## Design Goal

The goal of the design was to make the platform:
Simple and intuitive for both buyers and sellers

 - Culturally appropriate and bilingual (English & Kinyarwanda)


 - Easily navigable with minimal training
